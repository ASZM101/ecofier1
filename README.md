# Ecofier

Ecofier is an application created for the [CS Base Climate Hackathon](https://csbase-climatehack.devpost.com).

Ecofier is an app where users can take a picture of their room, and the app will suggest ideas to make it more
environmentally friendly or sustainable. The app will also provide a score based on how sustainable the room is.

This project is the frontend of the app, written in Kotlin.
